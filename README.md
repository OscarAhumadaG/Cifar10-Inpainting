# Cifar10-Inpainting

## Overview
This project focuses on image inpainting using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The goal is to develop a model capable of filling missing or damaged parts in images with realistic and visually appealing content.

## Project Structure
- **data**: Contains datasets used for training and testing.
- **models**: Includes the GAN model architecture and any additional models or modules.
- **utils**: Utility functions and scripts for data preprocessing, evaluation, and visualization.
- **Cifar10Inpainting.ipynb**: Main script for training the GAN model.

  

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
